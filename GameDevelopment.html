	<h1> Executive Summary </h1>
	<p> This games is action games having feature like jumping, climbing, and running
through many diverse levels. It is a video game in which the gameplay action is
viewed from a side-view camera angle, and as the player's character moves left
or right, the screen scrolls with them. It has seven different levels. The game difficulty starts slow and
easy but with the moment of player and number of coins it can be fast and faster . Player collect coin in different stages of game that can boost player speed and score. The camera is one of the most important elements in a 3D game. It acts as the
player's eyes, letting them see the game world from different points of view. In
my running game camera works just like a film camera. It can be panned,
tilted, and zoomed to frame scenes.

 <h2> Interaction Model </h2>
 <p> Interaction model is the part of the game in which the designers and creators
have to think about how much control they would want to give to their target
audience and how much their audience will be represented in the game. There
are two different types of interaction models which are Avatar Interaction
Model and Omnipresence Interactive Model. Our game is first person so we
use Avatar interaction model in our game. </p>
